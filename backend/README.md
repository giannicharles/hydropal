[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)]() [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)[![codecov.io Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/RickBr0wn/express-mongoose-template?branch=master)

This is a boilerplate template for speeding up the development process in making MERN apps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this boilerplate running locally you will need:

- a node package manager (yarn or npm)
- a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
- your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)
- mongoDB installed locally

If you want to use a cloud based solution such as [mLabs](https://mlab.com) that is fine, you just need to replace the `connection string` with the one provided by your cloud based solution.

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickBr0wn/express-mongoose-template <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

To start your own repository,

> **important:** make sure you are in the cloned directory.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository.

> Please credit this boilerplate if you build something fantastic!

## Routes

Inside of `./src/Controllers/index.js` are a collection of sample routes that involve the five primary `CRUD` functions of persistent storage.

- **GET** `./api/get-all-datas` - Get multiple documents from the database.
- **GET** `./api/get_single_data/:dataId` - Get a single document from the database, based on a dataId.
- **POST** `./api/create_a_data` - Creates a single document and assigns it a dataId.
- **DELETE** `./api/delete_a_data/:dataId` - Deletes a single document from the database, based on a dataId.
- **PATCH** `./api/update_a_data/:dataId` - Updates a single document from the database, based on a dataId.
